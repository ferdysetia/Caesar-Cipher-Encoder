# Caesar-Cipher-Encoder
Caesar Cipher Encoder allows you to encode text using the Caesar Cipher encryption method. Enter your text and shift value to get the result.

The Caesar cipher is a classic cryptographic method used to encode messages. This technique was first employed by Julius Caesar, a Roman general and leader, to send secret messages to his subordinates. The Caesar cipher works by replacing each letter in the original text (plaintext) with another letter located at a specific position in the alphabet. The shift in letter positions is determined by a fixed value known as the key.

How the Caesar Cipher Works?
Each letter in the original text is replaced with a letter that is a few steps ahead or behind in the alphabet.
For example, if the key is 3:

- The letter "A" becomes "D",
- The letter "B" becomes "E",
- And so on.

The substitution operates in a circular manner, so the last letter ("Z") wraps around to the first letter ("A").

Steps to Use the Caesar Cipher Encoder:

1. Enter the Text to Be Converted:
On the webpage, you will see a field labeled "Enter Text." Here, input the text you wish to encrypt using the Caesar Cipher.
- Example of text to input: "Hello World."

2. Enter the Shift Value:
Below the "Enter Text" field, there is a field labeled "Enter Shift."
- Input a number in this field to determine the letter shift in the text.
- For instance, if you want to shift the letters in the text by 3 positions, input the number 3 in the field.
- You can also use a negative value for a backward shift (e.g., -3 will shift the letters backward).

3. Click the "Convert" Button:
After entering the text and the shift value, click the "Convert" button to start the encryption process.
- The system will calculate the encryption result using the Caesar Cipher method with the specified shift.

4. View the Encrypted Result:
After clicking the "Convert" button, the encryption result will appear in the "Result" section.
- For example, if you input the text "Hello World" and choose a shift of 3, the result will be "Khoor Zruog."

5. Copy the Encrypted Text:
If you wish to copy the encryption result to your clipboard, you can press the "Copy Text" button.
- After pressing the button, the encrypted text will be copied to your clipboard, and you can paste it elsewhere.

6. Notifications:
- If the input is invalid (e.g., you enter characters other than letters and spaces, or if the shift value is not a number), an error message will appear using SweetAlert to notify you of the issue.
- If the shift value is outside the allowed range (between -25 and 25), you will also be notified with an error message.
